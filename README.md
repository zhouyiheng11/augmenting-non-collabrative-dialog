# Quick Start
## Constructing FST
This section provides step-by-step instrucitons on how to construct a FST described in the paper.

### Prepare input file
./finite_state_machine/wfst_train/persuasion/intent_wfst_persuasion_train is an example input file. Each line represents a sequence of dialog acts within one dialog session. They are separated by space.

### Train FST
./finite_state_machine/wfst_train/do_wfst_persuasion is the script to train FST.
1). Change WFST_BUILD and WFST_TRAIN accordingly.
2). Change line 10 to be your input file path
3). Change line 19 accordingly.
4). run the script ./finite_state_machine/wfst_train/do_wfst_persuasion

### Use FST
./wfst.py provides an interface that can read FST file, track the current state, and output state embedding.
